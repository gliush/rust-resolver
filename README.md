My first attempt to use Rust.
Resolver of all the urls from some text with some additional functionality:
 - find the final url (after several redirections)
 - get title for each url
 - ...


I was inspired by the following projects:
 - git@github.com:jgillich/rust-request.git
 - git@github.com:dpc/hyper-get.git
